Returns Matrix<double> A new matrix where each column has been centered (mean subtracted) and scaled (divided by standard deviation). If a column's standard deviation is zero, the data is only centered, without scaling. Remarks This method normalizes the input matrix by making each column have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is often useful for machine learning algorithms or statistical analysis. ComputeCorrelationMatrix(Matrix<double>) Computes the correlation matrix from the given data matrix. Each column of the data matrix represents a variable, and each row represents an observation. public static Matrix<double> ComputeCorrelationMatrix(Matrix<double> data) Parameters data Matrix<double> A matrix of size (n x m) where 'n' is the number of observations and 'm' is the number of variables. Returns Matrix<double> A correlation matrix of size (m x m) where the element at (i, j) represents the correlation coefficient between variables i and j. ComputeSignFlip(Svd<double>, Matrix<double>, out Matrix<double>, out Matrix<double>) The ComputeSignFlip function adjusts the signs of the singular vectors (both left and right) from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix in a consistent way. This is necessary because the SVD of a matrix is not unique: the signs of the singular vectors can be arbitrarily flipped (positive or negative) without changing the mathematical correctness of the decomposition. This function resolves these ambiguities by ensuring consistent signs across both the left and right singular vectors. public static void ComputeSignFlip(Svd<double> svd, Matrix<double> X, out Matrix<double> U_prime, out Matrix<double> V_prime) Parameters svd Svd<double> The MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Factorization.Svd<T> object that represents the singular value decomposition of a matrix. This object contains three components: U: Matrix of left singular vectors (orthonormal). V: Matrix of right singular vectors (orthonormal), typically transposed as VT in MathNet. S: Diagonal matrix of singular values (non-negative real numbers). X Matrix<double> The original matrix for which the SVD was computed. This matrix is used in the sign-flipping algorithm to help determine the appropriate signs of the singular vectors. U_prime Matrix<double> Output matrix of left singular vectors (U_prime) with adjusted signs. This matrix is a copy of U, where the signs of its columns are flipped as necessary to ensure consistency between the left and right singular vectors. V_prime Matrix<double> Output matrix of right singular vectors (V_prime) with adjusted signs. Similar to U_prime, this matrix is derived from V, but with adjusted signs to maintain consistency with the left singular vectors. Remarks In the context of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), given a matrix X, it can be factored into: X = U * S * V^T, where: U is a matrix of left singular vectors (orthonormal columns). S is a diagonal matrix of singular values (non-negative, real numbers). V^T is the transpose of the matrix of right singular vectors (orthonormal rows). However, the SVD is not unique because for any singular vector u_k and v_k (the k-th left and right singular vectors), flipping the sign of both (i.e., replacing u_k with -u_k and v_k with -v_k) leaves the product X = U * S * V^T unchanged. This means that without further constraints, there can be ambiguity in the signs of the singular vectors. The ComputeSignFlip function eliminates this ambiguity by ensuring that the signs of the left (U) and right (V) singular vectors are consistent. The function evaluates the sign of each singular vector by analyzing its relationship with the original data matrix X. It adjusts the signs of the singular vectors to minimize inconsistencies, leading to a more interpretable and consistent SVD. This process is useful when using SVD for dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA), and other applications where the interpretability and consistency of the singular vectors is important. GetWeighedMatrix(Matrix<double>, Vector<double>, Vector<double>) Applies row and column weights to the input matrix by adjusting each element based on the square roots of the corresponding row and column weights. This transformation is often used in dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to balance the influence of each row and column while preserving the overall structure of the data. public static Matrix<double> GetWeighedMatrix(Matrix<double> X, Vector<double> rowWeights = null, Vector<double> colWeights = null) Parameters X Matrix<double> The input matrix where rows represent observations and columns represent features. rowWeights Vector<double> A vector of weights corresponding to each row in the matrix. If not provided, uniform weights are assumed, meaning each row has an equal contribution. The weights are normalized to sum to 1. colWeights Vector<double> A vector of weights corresponding to each column in the matrix. If not provided, each column is assumed to have an equal weight of 1, meaning each feature has an equal contribution. Returns Matrix<double> A new matrix where each element is scaled by the square root of its respective row and column weights. Remarks The square root of the weights is used to ensure that the overall weighting remains balanced. Multiplying by the square root of both row and column weights means that the scaling for each matrix element is proportional to the contribution of both its row and column without overly inflating or diminishing the influence of any single weight. This allows the matrix to be transformed in such a way that maintains relative distances between data points, which is crucial for algorithms like PCA, where geometric relationships (such as variance) are important."
